Fall 2019

In this course, we will survey the statistical methods used for the analysis of categorical data including methods for analyzing binary, multinominal, and count response variables. Tests and confidence intervals for the difference in proportions, relative risks, odds ratio, matched pairs, and logistic regression will be discussed. Nominal and ordinal responses will be considered. Additional topics may include larger contingency tables and Poisson, and negative binomial regression models. Applications include examples in biology, economics, agriculture, and industry. R statistical software will be used for data analysis.
